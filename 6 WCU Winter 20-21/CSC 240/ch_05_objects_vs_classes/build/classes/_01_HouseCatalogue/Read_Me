What you need to master from each sub-package
*********************************************

1. Class files and separate compilation
    - Be careful both House.java and House_Catalogue_01.java should be on the same package:
        - Running : House_Catalogue_01.java (The one you should run).
        - Implementation: House.java (The one has the details).

** Note: for exercise: Run House.java and see what happens.

2. Instance Variables
    - belong to a class

3. We create (instantiate) objects using the new keyword inside main ().
